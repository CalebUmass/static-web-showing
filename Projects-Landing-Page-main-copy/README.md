### Navigating this project!
This project consists of all the folders within the repository, but this folder in particular holds the main landing page and the page with all the links to projects. The **index.html** file holds the code for the main webpage, and the **homepage.css** file holds all the design for that page. The homepage links to the projects page, whose code is contained within the **projects-page.html** file and the **projectspage.css** file. The **Adding New Pages to the Website** file includes all relevant information on how to add your own data science projects to the website.

### About this project
This project was created by Malie Geery in 2025 as a part of the Poggio Civitate Data Science program. The goal of this project is a simple landing page for users to more easily find data science projects utilities. The goal of this project in particular was to make the projects done in the past more accessible to anyone at the digsite. By hosting these projects on a website, it makes it easier for any user to browse through all the projects that have been done, and easily navigate to the tool they require. This felt especially necessary given that so many of the data science projects created in the past have been created to work as utilities those working in the magazzino. By creating a website to host all of these projects, I hope that these projects are more accessible, and therefore get to be more widely used, in the coming years.

### Acknowledgements
I want to extend my gratitude to Cole Reilly, Anthony Tuck, and the rest of the staff at Poggio Civitate for their support on this project and for the opportunity to work with the team this summer. I also want to thank my fellow data science students for all their help on this project and other projects over the summer.
