### Navigating this project!

This project consists of all the folders within the repository, but this folder in particular holds the main landing page and the page with all the links to projects. The **index.html** file holds the code for the main webpage, and the **homepage.css** file holds all the design for that page. The homepage links to the projects page, whose code is contained within the **projects-page.html** file and the **projectspage.css** file. The **Adding New Pages to the Website** file includes all relevant information on how to add your own data science projects to the website.
