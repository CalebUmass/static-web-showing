### Navigating this project!
This project consists of two main files, along with multiple files within media. The **index.html** file holds both the HTML code and the Javascript. Each section of the HTML, as well as each <script> tag is labelled in the code, with description of what each does. The major script tags include the following functions: 
- Controlling sidebar movement
- Searching the filter pills
- Sorting functionality
- A script to autogenerate pills
- A script that controls all filters in the sidebar-- both the range slider and the pill filters
The **style.css** file controls the display of the website.

### About this project
This project was created by Malie Geery in 2025 as a part of the Poggio Civitate Data Science program. The goal of this project was to make drawings done by students in the past that aren't associated with a specific find or trench viewable and searchable. I also hope that with this project, it is easier to find any relevant images. The search, sort, filter by pill, and filter by range functions all serve as ways for users to be able to use the website as seamlessly as possible. 

### Going Forward
Going forward, a useful utility would be to add a feature to the website that would allow people to add files from the web, instead of having to manually code it in for each image. This way, non-data science students would be able to add files to this project as well.

### Acknowledgements
I want to extend my gratitude to Cole Reilly, Anthony Tuck, and the rest of the staff at Poggio Civitate for their support on this project and for the opportunity to work with the team this summer. I also want to thank my fellow data science students for all their help on this project and other projects over the summer.
