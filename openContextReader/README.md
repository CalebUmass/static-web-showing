# READ ME
*Made by Ai Mei Zhang*

# Contents
The project consists of an HTML, CSS and Javascript file. 
HTML: contains all the dropdown, button, selective, as well as a few decorative elements. 
Javascript: has button functions, event listeners, as well as functions to read user input and apply them to the Open Context url.
CSS: has some basic animations, color settings and styling. 

# About 
This webpage was made by Ai Mei Zhang in 2025 for the Poggio Civitate Data Science program. The purpose is to simplify 
artifact searching and filtering for users who aren't familiar with the excavation team's terminology. 

# Going Forward
There is no *good* mobile view for this webpage yet, it's recommended you only browse it on desktop. 
To adjust the website for mobile devices, I think restructuring the HTML and CSS for bootstrap would work. 
If more filtering options be need added, please refer to the "Adding Dropdowns" pdf file in this folder.

# Acknowledements
Thank you to Cole Reilly and my fellow data-science students, Caleb & Malie for all your help. 
Additionally, I'd like to thank Poggio Civitate's excavation staff & team for giving me the chance to work with data you've painstakenly organized.
